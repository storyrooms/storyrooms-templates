# ENHANCED CORRIDOR V2
# Core rendering logic for presentation corridor

# ⚠️ TO BE MIGRATED FROM GOTHENBURG 3D SCENES PROJECT
# This file will contain the working code from enhanced_corridor_v2.R

# The code already exists and works!
# Just needs to be copied here from the old project.

# MIGRATION STEPS (Week 1):
# 1. Copy enhanced_corridor_v2.R from old project
# 2. Clean up and remove Gothenburg-specific parts
# 3. Make it work with config.yaml instead of hardcoded values
# 4. Test with example slides
# 5. Document functions

# Current status: Placeholder
# Week 1 goal: Working migrated version
# Week 2 goal: Productified with config support
